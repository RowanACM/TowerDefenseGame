# TowerDefenseGame
This is the repository for our tower defense game! Please keep your projects in their own separate folders in the repository. The goal here is to have a repository we can clone straight into our Unity project's assets folder to have the most up to date version of the game!


Please commit changes to the appropriate branch, not master! There is a branch for each group's work. Only when your work is free of errors should you then commit your changes to master.
